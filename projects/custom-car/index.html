<p>For this Godot project, I made a custom wheel system from the ground up, designed to deliver a customizable and engaging driving experience.</p>

<p>I made a custom <code>Wheel</code> class that simulates semi-realistic car wheel physics using <code>RayCast3D</code> nodes for ground detection. It handles suspension, acceleration, steering, and various friction forces.</p>
<h3>Detailed Wheel Simulation</h3>
<p>Each wheel is individually simulated to provide authentic car behavior:</p>
<div class="skill-category">
<ul>
    <li><strong>Suspension:</strong> A spring and damper system for each wheel effectively handles bumps and uneven terrain, ensuring a smooth ride.</li>
    <li><strong>Traction and Steering:</strong> Realistic acceleration and steering forces are applied to the wheels, allowing for precise control and dynamic maneuvers.</li>
    <li><strong>Friction:</strong> Both rolling friction and lateral friction are meticulously simulated to provide a realistic driving feel, preventing unnatural sliding.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dynamic Camera</h3>
<p>The simulation features an <strong>orbiting camera</strong> that intelligently follows the car. Players can control the camera's perspective with the mouse, and it automatically rotates to align with the car's direction when moving, enhancing immersion.</p>

<h3>Sound Effects</h3>
<p>To further enhance realism, the simulation includes <strong>dynamic sound effects</strong>. The engine sounds change convincingly with speed and acceleration, providing auditory feedback, and collision sounds add impact to the driving experience.</p>


<p>This custom made system was key to achieving a responsive and authentic driving experience, offering precise control over car behavior for use in any vehicle project in the future.</p>
